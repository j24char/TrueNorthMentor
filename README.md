# True North Mentor App
The True North Mentor app is a tracker and a resource for suggested challenges to help you become a better version of yourself.  Once logged in, you are able to review the database of suggested challenges, select ones that you feel you can work towards, and monitor your progress. It also has a daily suggested challenge to remind you to work to improve yourself every day.
